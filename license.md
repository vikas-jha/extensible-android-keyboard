## Preamble

This license modifies the Apache License 2.0 by restricting free use to individuals and organizations that do not exceed certain size and financial thresholds. It also explicitly prohibits the use of the software in AI model training. Large entities and AI developers must obtain a commercial license.

## Definitions

All original terms from the Apache License 2.0 apply, except as modified below.

- **"Qualifying Entity"** means any individual or organization that:
  1. Employs *no more than 1,000 total personnel*, including employees, full-time contractors, and part-time staff (counted as full-time equivalents), **and**
  2. Has *less than USD 1 billion* in either:
     - Annual gross revenue, **or**
     - Market capitalization.

- **"Large Entity"** means any organization that exceeds either threshold above.

- **"AI Model Training"** means using the software or any derivative work, in whole or in part, training data for a machine learning model or artificial intelligence system.

## 1. Grant of License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License:

- The Licensor grants all rights under Sections 2–9 of the original Apache License 2.0 to **Qualifying Entities** and **individual users**, including rights to use, reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works of, publicly perform and display, sublicense, and distribute the Work.

- **Large Entities** are not granted any rights under this license. Use, modification, or distribution by a Large Entity requires a **separate commercial license** from the Licensor.

## 10. AI Use Restriction

- The Software, including any part of its code or data, **may not be used for training or fine-tuning AI or machine learning models** without a separate, explicit license from the Licensor.
- Any violation of this restriction results in the **automatic termination** of this license.
- Furthermore, if the Software is used—legally or illegally—for AI training or fine-tuning, then:
  - All **AI-generated outputs** influenced by this Software must be released as **open source under this license** or a license compatible with the Apache License 2.0.

## 11. Compliance Verification

- The Licensor may request reasonable documentation to verify compliance with the “Qualifying Entity” definition or AI usage restrictions.
- Misrepresentation of eligibility or unauthorized AI usage **voids this license**.
